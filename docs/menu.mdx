# Menu

<img src={menuImgUrl} alt="Menu" style={{ maxHeight: "500px" }} />

## Editor Layout

Switch between the following layouts:

- Track: show the 2D Track only
- 3D: show the 3D Track only
- Track | 3D: show both 2D and 3D Track side by side
- Track | Library Editor: show the 2D Track and Library Editor side by side

## Track3D Controls

<img
  src={menuTrack3DControlsImgUrl}
  alt="List of Track 3D control options"
  style={{ maxHeight: "200px" }}
/>

Only visible when 3D Track is visible. Choose between different control modes.

- First Person: enter this mode to walk around the track using a keyboard and mouse. (There is a decade old bug in Chrome, when you rotate over 360 degrees the screen might jump a bit. Depends on the system.)
- Map: rotate around a green center, which is placed on the floor
  - Drag: move the track around, thereby moving the center
  - Ctrl + drag or right mouse drag: rotate around the center
  - Scroll up / down: zoom in / out
  - On touchscreens you can move with single finger drag, and zoom/rotate with pinch / double finger drag
- Drag: coming from the map mode you can drag the skaters around on the track. <experimental />
- Gamepad: try hooking up your gamepad. You can move/look with the analogue sticks and increase/decrease with the X / Y buttons (depending on the layout) <experimental />

## Import / Export

- Open Track: open a previously exported JSON Track Data file
- Save Track (Save link as): Export the current Track as a JSON file. This is a link, so you can right click or hold tap and then choose "Save link as" to store the file and choose a filename. It will also download if clicked, but you can't choose the filename.

## Library

- Open Library: open a previously exported Library JSON file. This gives access to the Library Editor and Sequence Controls.
- Close Library (when library is loaded): clears all sequences and descriptions from the current library.

- Documentation: Link to this documentation
- Settings: opens the [Settings](./settings.md) modal

# 3D Track

<img

  alt="A 3D track with a settings menu opened in the upper right and a VR not supported button at the bottom"
/>

## Controls

You can select different controls from the [Menu](./menu)

## Settings

Find the settings wheel in the upper right corner. You can optionally load a wall and floor textures.

Choose a model for the skaters. There is also a human model created using [http://www.makehumancommunity.org/](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/). The team colors choosen in the Menu [Settings](./settings#colors) are currently not having any effect on the model colors.

Graphics quality increases/decreases the resolution. If the 3d control interaction takes too long try reducing the quality.

## VR Mode

There is a small button at the bottom of the 3D Track. If it says VR NOT SUPPORTED, then the button will be disabled. Otherwise:

Grab a Google Card Board and run the track in VR on your smartphone (supporting device required). Connect a bluetooth keyboard or bluetooth gamepad to your smartphone to control the VR camera. You can set the eyeheight in settings or using the X/Y buttons on the gamepad.

<experimental />: The experience is mainly experimental. No support for actual
VR headsets (yet). It might just work opening the site in your VR browser and
clicking the button.
